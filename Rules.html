        <h3>How to Play Volleyball
            A volleyball game consists of two teams of six players each, separated by a net. The six volleyball court
            positions are
            setter, middle blocker, outside hitter, opposite hitter, libero and serving specialist.

            To start, flip a coin to determine which team serves the ball first.

            Then the two teams will rally—or hit the ball back and forth over the net—until a fault occurs. There is a
            maximum of
            three hits per side.

            The objective is to score points by sending the ball over the net, grounding it into the opponent’s court.

            Volleyball matches are made up of sets, typically three or five sets.

            Three-set matches are two sets to 25 points and a third set to 15 points. Each set must be won by two
            points.
            The first
            team to win two sets is the winner of the match.

            Five-set matches are four sets to 25 points and a fifth set to 15 points. The team must win by two points
            unless
            tournament rules dictate otherwise. The first team to win three sets is the winner.

            Volleyball Rules
            Here are the fundamental, must-know rules of a volleyball game:

            Only 6 players on the floor at any given time: 3 in the front row and 3 in the back row.
            Points are made on every serve for the winning team of the rally (rally-point scoring).
            Players may not hit the ball twice in succession (a block is not considered a hit).
            Ball may be played off the net during a volley and on a serve.
            A ball hitting a boundary line is in.
            A ball is out if it hits an antennae, the floor completely outside the court, any of the net or cables
            outside
            the
            antennae, the referee stand or pole, or the ceiling above a non-playable area.
            It is legal to contact the ball with any part of a player’s body.
            It is illegal to catch, hold or throw the ball.
            A player cannot block or attack a serve from on or inside the 10-foot line.
            After the serve, front-line players may switch positions at the net.
            Matches are made up of sets; the number depends on level of play.
            Volleyball Rule Violations
            Committing any of these volleyball rule violations results in a point for the opponent.

            Stepping on or across the service line when serving while making contact with the ball.
            Failure to serve the ball over the net successfully.
            Ball-handling errors and contacting the ball illegally (double touching, lifting, carrying, throwing, etc.)
            Touching the net with any part of the body while the ball is in play.
            Blocking a ball coming from the opponent’s court and contacting the ball when reaching over the net if your
            opponent has
            not used 3 contacts AND has a player there to make a play on the ball.
            Attacking a ball coming from the opponent’s court and contacting the ball when reaching over the net when
            the
            ball has
            not yet broken the vertical plane of the net.
            Crossing the court centerline with any part of your body, with the exception of a hand or foot. It is only
            considered a
            violation if the entire hand or entire foot crosses the court centerline.
            Serving out of rotation or out of order.
            Back row player blocking (deflecting a ball coming from the opponent) when, at the moment of contact, the
            back
            row
            player is near the net and has part of their body above the top of the net. This is an illegal block.
            Back row player attacking a ball inside the front zone (the area inside the 3M/10-foot line) when, at the
            moment
            of
            contact, the ball is completely above the net. This is an illegal attack.</h3>
